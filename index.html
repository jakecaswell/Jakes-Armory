                    This is my Death Knight. This character is the character that I main, which means the character that
                    I invest the most time into, this expansion. I focus on PvP (player vs player) on this character,
                    but sometimes do other things like dungeons.

                    This is my rogue. They are the first character that I ever really played in this game. I have not
                    played this character much at all this expansion, but they it is my overall most played character by
                    a large margin. I used to PvP on this character all the time.

                    This is my final max level character, my warrior. I don't really play this character at all either.
                    I just leveled this character because warriors are the most overpowered class in the game and I
                    wanted to have one. But I learned that I do not like the class and didn't end up playing it after
                    hitting max level.

                    This was my only character from the classic realms that they released. The classic version of WoW
                    was just a re-release of the vanilla version of the game. It was a lot of fun due to the people that
                    I played with and I invested a lot of my time during the quarantine to this game and character. In
                    this game I not only did PvP, which I did a lot of, but I also dabbled in some PvE, doing raids and
                    dungeons. They kept going with classic and went on to the first expansion, but I didn't play it this
                    time, so my character is only level 60 and not the new level cap, 70.
